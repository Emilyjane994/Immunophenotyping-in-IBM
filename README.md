# Identification of distinct immune signatures in Inclusion Body Myositis by peripheral blood immunophenotyping using machine learning models 
Identification of relevant biomarkers for Inclusion Body Myositis by peripheral blood immunophenotyping using machine learning models.

# Background:
Inclusion Body Myositis (IBM) is a progressive late-onset muscle disease characterized by preferential weakness of the quadriceps femoris and finger flexors, which responds poorly to treatment. The underlying causes of IBM remain elusive, potentially involving immune, degenerative, genetic, and age-related factors. The diverse clinical presentations and overlap with normal muscle ageing make diagnosis and prognosis for the rate of progression problematic.

In the present study, we performed detailed immunophenotyping of peripheral blood leukocytes by multi-parameter flow cytometry in a comparative cross-sectional analysis of a cohort of IBM patients and healthy controls. We used computational models to predict novel biomarkers for IBM and evaluate their performance. We also aimed to compare the immunophenotypes between IBM patients using unsupervised clustering methods, and to investigate correlations with clinical and functional measures in order to gain a deeper understanding of the causes and effects of the heterogeneity observed across IBM patients.
